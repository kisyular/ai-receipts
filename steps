4. Critical Implementation Issues
   Backend Issues:
   File Cleanup: Files saved to disk but never cleaned up (memory leak)
   Error Handling: Generic exception catching loses specific error context
   Database: SQLite with check_same_thread=False (not production-ready)
   Security: CORS allows all origins (allow_origins=["*"])
   Frontend Issues:
   Duplicate HTML: index.html has duplicate sections (lines 150-200)
   Fake Progress: Progress bar is simulated, not real
   Camera Handling: No fallback for camera permission denial
   Error Recovery: Limited error recovery mechanisms
5. Missing Components
   Backend Missing:
   Health check endpoint (/health referenced but not implemented)
   File cleanup mechanism
   Authentication/authorization
   Rate limiting
   Logging system
   Frontend Missing:
   Offline.html page (referenced in service worker)
   IndexedDB implementation for offline storage
   Real background sync implementation
   Push notification setup
6. Architecture Patterns
   Good Patterns:
   Separation of concerns (frontend/backend)
   RESTful API design
   Progressive enhancement (PWA features)
   Error boundaries and fallbacks
   Problematic Patterns:
   Tight coupling between UI sections and JavaScript
   Manual DOM manipulation instead of reactive patterns
   Hardcoded API URLs
   No state management library
7. Production Readiness
   Ready For:
   Development and testing
   Basic receipt analysis functionality
   Local deployment
   Not Ready For:
   Production deployment (security, scalability, monitoring)
   High-volume usage (file storage, database performance)
   Multi-user scenarios (no authentication)
   This is a functional prototype with good core functionality but needs significant hardening for production use.
